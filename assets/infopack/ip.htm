						Why hello there, it's <a href="http://twitter.com/phazonoverload">Kevin</a> here. SAP Young Rewired State 2012 is only a few weeks away now, and we're still receiving quite a lot of questions from you guys. We realised that the best way to keep everyone on the same page was to produce this information pack. This covers pretty much everything you need to know - from travel arrangements and where to go to get help, to messages, tips, tricks and free stuff from some of our very lovely sponsors.
					</p>  
          <p>
            It is really important to us that your talent is not exploited and your youth is not taken advantage of. To help with this, we have produced an advice document. Please do take time to read it, you can download it from <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org/img/YRS_adviceforkids.pdf">here</a>.

									</p>
									<p>
										Pair! Find a buddy and work together. On everything. Take it in turns to be the Navigator (the one with the plan) and the Driver (the one doing the typing). You'll get so much more work done, with fewer bugs, and with better structure. Oh, and it's *way* more fun than hacking alone.
									</p>
									<p>
										Always have a pen and paper on you. Complex functions and data structures are made simple and straightforward as soon as they're drawn on paper. It's magic. Especially when you've been coding for 10 hours straight and can't tell your keyboard from your elbow.
									</p>
									<p>
										It's easy to get lost in code and lose sight of the end goal. Step away from the computer! Take a break. Talk to your users, and talk to your peers. Both will give you invaluable clues as to what's right or wrong about your current solution. And even if they don't, at least you've met someone new!

					<span>How to get help</span>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<div>
						<p>
							Like I said earlier, don't be afraid to ask for help - people will be around to help. The most powerful thing about being at a hackday is that there will always be someone who knows what you don't, and more often than not - they will be happy to help. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Young Rewired State isn't just an event, it's a network of young people across the country. Before, during, and after the week of SAP Young Rewired State 2012, you will be able to ask for help from other participants, mentors, and well - me. Here's how you can get help throughout the week...
						</p>
						<h3>Mentors</h3><br>
						<p>
							In every centre, there will be at least one mentor, possibly several. These mentors don't just have a pretty face, almost all of them know at least one programming language. 'Why are these silly over 18s here?' you may be thinking - they are there to help you. You can ask them at any time for support. 
						</p>
						<h3>Other Ways</h3><br>
						<p>
							Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23yrs2012">#yrs2012</a> for anything relating to SAP Young Rewired State 2012 and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23yrshelp">#yrshelp</a> for technical help throughout the week.  
						</p>
						<p>
							Channel #yrs2012 on FreeNode IRC. You can use the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">web client</a> if you don't have a standalone client on your machine.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="mailto:kids@youngrewiredstate.org">kids@youngrewiredstate.org</a> before, during and after the week for any questions or concerns about the event itself. I'll be manning this, so if you must ask a technical question, keep it simple.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="callto://youngrewiredstate/">'youngrewiredstate'</a> on Skype throughout the week for technical help from <a href="http://twitter.com/cholten99">Dave Durant</a>

					<h2>Kit</h2>
					<span>What you'll need</span>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						You must bring a laptop to your centre throughout the week. On it should be any development tools that you are comfortable using. We do not expect you to use any specific tools, nor do we expect you to use specific programming language - if they're good enough for you, they're good enough for us.
					</p>
					<p>
						You are free to create hacks which incorporate hardware, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pis or development devices - but you will have to bring those along with you. 
					</p>
					<p>
						You should've already found out which centre you'll be at for the week (if not, <a href="mailto:centres@rewiredstate.org">contact us</a>). You will find out the arrangements for food before the week - you may have to bring money for food and drink, it will vary between centres.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the Festival of Code you should bring a sleeping bag and a change of clothes, more on that below...

						<p>
							<b>You must get a ticket to this event <a href="http://yrs12foc.eventbrite.com/">here</a>.</b> They are free, but we need to keep track of numbers for admission.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Festival of Code is being run in Birmingham at The Custard Factory. The nearest station is Birmingham New Street, and it's a twenty minute walk at my snail's pace.
						</p>
						<p>
							You will travel there with the other people at your centre on Friday night. We've organised some incredible people to come and speak to you, you can also continue coding on Friday night. You will then sleep on the floors in sleeping bags, in true hack day style - bring floor mats, clothes and whatever else to make yourself feel comfortable. 
						</p><br>
						<p>
							We do NOT want money to bwe the reason thatyou are not at the Festival of Code, so the hardship fund is there to help. The applications to hardship fund close on Friday 3<sup>rd</sup> August. After this date - all fundswill be allocated and no firtherallocations can be recieved. If you want to apply - please fill in the form which you can find <a href="http://share.jellybabi.es/resources/hardship.pdf">here</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are aged <b>13 or below</b>, you will be sleeping in an area together. You must have a parent or guardian with you at all times. You must have a parent or guardian on the Friday night, but will not be able to sleep over on the Saturday night as we will only have two seperate sleeping areas. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are aged <b>14 to 17</b>, you will be sleeping in a different area. You must have written permission from your parents or guardians in order to stay over.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are aged <b>18</b>, you will be sleeping in a third area.
						</p><br>
						<p>
							If you absolutely hate the idea of sleeping on the floor and your parent or guardian wants to stay in a hotel, we can help you arrange that - but we can't pay for it, sorry. To find hotels to stay in during the Festival of Code - you can use <a href="http://visitbirmingham.com/where-to-stay/">www.visitbirmingham.com</a>. We have a deal for £80 bed and breakfast per night (based on two sharing a room) at <a href="http://hotel-latour.co.uk/">Hotel Latour</a>. Just use the code 'REWIRED' when booking. If you choose to do this, you must ensure that you have organised this with your centre lead in advance and have teamed up with them by 9am on the Saturday morning at The Custard Factory.
						</p>
						<p> 
							Food will be provided to participants, but parents and guardians will have to bring cash with them for the bar and food concessions that we will have on site.
						</p>
						<p>
							There will be five concurrent show and tells on Saturday morning. We've called the group of centres presenting together a 'team' (more below). The show and tells will be judged and the winners from each will then go on to the final in the afternoon. The final will be live streamed. Each centre must be able to present off of one laptop. The laptop must be able to output to VGA. You need any adaptors to make this possible. We will have a way to let you show phone apps, just in case you wondered.
						</p>
						<p>
							Each centre is limited in the number of hacks they can show at the Festival of Code. Unless otherwise stated, each centre can have three hacks. We've worked this out based on the number of participants per centre.

					<h2>What is Young Rewired State?</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
						There is no end to the number of great resources out there to teach young people programming. While they are fantastic, learning is often an isolating and solitary activity. The aim for Young Rewired State is to give young people who have taught themselves to code a community of like-minded people.
					</p>
					<p>
						On another note - hackdays are usually one to two day events where participants identify problems and rapidly create prototypes which demonstrate a range of solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Young Rewired State is a week-long hack event for passionate under 19s. We’re now in our fourth year and SAP Young Rewired State 2012 will be held from Monday 6th to Saturday 11th of August 2012.
					</p>
					<p>
						The underlying premise is simple – you have one week. Using at least one piece of open data, you must create at least one cool product or prototype (called ‘hacks’) that will be shown off to everyone else at the end of the week for a shot at some awesome prizes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Young Rewired State is not designed to TEACH you how to code, it's designed to give young people who already know how to code a place to be. If you don't know how to code already, don't worry - there are some awesome resources to help teach you in this pack. Take time to go through them. No one will look down at you for having limited knowledge, they're there to help.
