		<p>We know you guys like bullet points, so here they are:</p>

<p>SAP YRS 2012 happens in centres across the UK â€” a centre is a business that has space and wifi to take up to 10 kids</p>

<ul><li>we assign kids from central sign up as well as local recruiting (by centres)</li>
<li>we ensure that each centre has at least one mentor for the Monday - Thursday</li>
<li>we are trying to assign one alumnus per centre this year as well (but that might not be possible)</li></ul>

<h2>Mentors will:</h2>
<ul><li>help the kids get ideas in the first place (Monday)</li>
<li>understand the data</li>
<li>help with programming where necessary</li>
<li>do stand up presentations with the kids every day</li>
<li>liaise with each other and share skills remotely if necessary</li>
<li>assist with the prep for final presentation</li>
<li>be invited to mentor at the festival of code on the Friday/Saturday when all the kids are together</li></ul>
